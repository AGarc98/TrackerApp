Phase 1: The Foundation (Database & Architect CRUD)

Objective: Set up the "Brain" of the app and the administrative tools to manage the exercise library.

    Prompt 1:
    "Using the attached SRS and Design Doc, we will implement a React Native project (targeting Mobile, we will create the desktop app later).

        The main app initialization has been set up.

        Implement the schema defined in Section 2 of the Design Doc, including the Muscle_Group enums, the Exercises table with the is_base_content flag, and the Routines tables.

        Create a 'seed' script to populate the initial list of muscle groups.

        Build the 'Architect Zone' Exercise Editor: a dedicated management page where I can Create, Read, Update, and Delete exercises. Use a simple, clean UI library or custom styles as per the design doc."

Phase 2: The "Active Session" Engine

Objective: Build the core logic that handles the actual workout tracking and data persistence.

    Prompt 2:
    "Referencing the 'Active Session Engine' (Section 3) and 'Athlete Zone' (Section 3.1) of the Design Doc:

        Implement the Draft_Sets table for session persistence.

        Create a React Context-based state manager to handle an active workout.

        Build the logic to:

            Start a workout (cloning a Routine into Draft_Sets).

            Perform 'Volatile Swapping' of an exercise for the current session only.

            Handle the 'Finish' action using an atomic SQL transaction to move data from Drafts to Logged_Sessions and Logged_Sets.

        Ensure that if the app is closed and reopened, it checks Draft_Sets and prompts to 'Resume' the workout."

Phase 3: Desktop Implementation & Navigation

Objective: Pivot to the Windows-specific experience and the Master-Detail layout.

    Prompt 3:
    "Now focus on the Windows Desktop implementation.

        Implement the 'Fixed Sidebar Navigation' described in Section 6.1.

        Create the 'Master-Detail' view for Routines: selecting a routine in the sidebar should show its details and history in the main content pane.

        Implement keyboard listeners for desktop: Ctrl+N to start a new workout, Ctrl+S to finish/save, and Tab/Enter navigation for rep/weight input fields.

        Ensure the UI responds to hover states for data points as specified in the SRS."

Phase 4: Data Vault & Local Sync

Objective: Build the privacy-first sync and encryption features.

    Prompt 4:
    "Implement the 'Central Hub' sync model and security features from Sections 4 and 5 of the Design Doc.

        Create a JSON Export/Import utility. Include an option to encrypt the exported file using AES-256-GCM with a user-provided passkey.

        Build the Local Network Sync:

            Desktop: Logic to generate a QR code containing the Local IP and a session token.

            Mobile: Logic to scan the QR, connect via LAN, and perform a 'Two-Way Sync' using 'Last Write Wins' logic via the last_modified column.

        Ensure progress photos are stored in a standard local directory (PrivateLift/Media) and included in the export container."

Phase 5: Analytics & "Athlete" Experience

Objective: Finalize the user-facing data visualization and UX polish.

    Prompt 5:
    "Finalize the 'Athlete Zone' and Analytics module (Section 4 and 7).

        Implement the Epley Formula for e1RM calculations based on logged sets.

        Build the 'Configurable Data Grid' (Pivot Table) for the Analytics page. Users must be able to group and filter data by: Date, Muscle Group, and Exercise.

        Implement the 'Hard Stop' rest day logic in the settings: if enabled, prevent starting a new cycle until a calendar day has passed.

        Connect the Progress Photo gallery to display images from the local filesystem associated with specific dates/biometrics."

Tips for working with the AI Agent:

    One Step at a Time: Don't feed all 5 prompts at once. Wait for the agent to finish Phase 1 and verify the database is working before moving to the Engine.

    Ask for Tests: For Phase 2 (The Engine), specifically tell the AI: "Write a unit test to ensure that the SQL Transaction rolls back if one set fails to save." This is crucial for a "robust" design.

    Verify Filesystem Access: Since you are using React Native for Windows, remind the AI to use native modules that are compatible with the Windows filesystem (like react-native-fs or Windows-specific equivalents).
